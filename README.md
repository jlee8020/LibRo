- Brianna's story is that of a "rags to riches". From a humble beginning of growing up in a third world country with almost nothing in her posession Brianna worked hard, becoming a CEO of a Fortune 100 Company. She credits her success to her self-help book collection where she learned many things from dealing with people to running a successful business.
